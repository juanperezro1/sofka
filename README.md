# Quiz App - Sofka

Quiz App built with Flutter. It was developed with flutter hooks and riverpod hooks packages. Also, firebase was used for the persistence of the data (score of a player).

The questions that are used in the application are extracted from an API called API Trivia, which generates a JSON response with attributes such as the question, the options after, the correct answer, the category and the difficulty.
